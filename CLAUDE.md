# Project Setup

## Session Initialization

Always start a new session by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This ensures all dependencies are properly installed and up-to-date before beginning work.

## Documentation

- `./docs/feature_plans.md` - Planned and implemented features
- `./docs/shelved_ideas.md` - Ideas that have been postponed or rejected
