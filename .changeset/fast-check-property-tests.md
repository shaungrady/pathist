Add comprehensive property-based tests using fast-check. Complements existing parametric tests with tests that verify algebraic properties and invariants across thousands of automatically-generated test cases, including round-trip parsing, comparison properties (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity), manipulation properties (slice/concat identity, associativity), and configuration propagation.
